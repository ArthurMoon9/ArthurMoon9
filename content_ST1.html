        <h2>Assessing and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Assessing and Evaluating your curriculum is one of the KEY attributes when it 
            comes to quality education. To achieve such valuable skill, you need to 
            follow these steps: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Set clear goals</li>
            <p>Make sure all your goals are written in short and simple sentences. It helps to 
                be focused on the goal specifically and not to get 
                confused during executing the given task.</p>
            <li>Short-term goals are very important too!!!</li>
            <p>You must have a “GLOBAL” goal. However, if you were to break down this goal into a couple of 
                short goals, it's going to make your life much easier as you will be 
                able to see your improvements after completing each short goal.</p>
            <li>Get feedback</li>
            <p>It is a very important attribute in improving your curriculum. As you will be able to see from 
                different perspectives
                the given task, plan, or whatever it may be.</p>
            <li>Alter study methods. </li>
            <p>There are occasions when there is only one way to achieve the specific task. But most of the time, 
                if you feel stuck, bored or confused, you may change the method of approaching the task and most of 
                the time it can help to speed up the process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These features will help to reflect and learn from the mistakes and better your knowledge.</p>
        </ul>
